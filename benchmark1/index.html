        <h3>This document describes a game called “Calm The Calamities”, which is a top-down, RPG/puzzle game in which you use different elemental abilities to save a world that you have created. This game employs many basic 2D game techniques such as tiled backgrounds, collision detection, and efficient memory management.</h3>

        <h3>Calm The Calamities will be developed as a web application using the Wolfie2D game engine, created by Richard McKenna. Original music and sounds will be created using Petaporon, and original artwork will be created using Piskel and Tiled.</h3>

        <h1 class="header">Backstory</h1>
        <h3>You are a young god who just finished creating your first world. You feel tired after making the world so you decided to take a nap. The nap turns into a millennium long slumber. While you were asleep, your powers leaked out from your body into your world. They took the shape of violent spirits, creating all kinds of natural disasters throughout your world. </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="center">
        <h1 class="header">Objective</h1>
        <h3>Your job is to navigate through a series of puzzles, navigating around various elements (“calamities”) that serve as obstacles, and defeating the boss spirits to gain your elemental powers back.</h3>
        <h3>
        Each level consists of two rooms, a puzzle room and a boss room. The level is focused around a certain calamity (e.g. earth, wind, etc), although multiple calamities can be present in a level. You can use your elemental powers to assist you as well in this area. Once you clear the puzzle room, you will fight a boss spirit that can damage you, and you must defeat it to gain its power and move on to the next level.
        </h3>

        <h1 class="header">Gameplay</h1>
        <h3>This game will play as a top-down puzzle RPG. In each level, you will use any elemental powers you have gained (you will only have your fists at the start) to solve the puzzle and defeat the boss. For each element/calamity, they can serve as an obstacle which you can interact with if it is in front of you, and which you can place yourself if you have defeated the boss spirit of that element.</h3>
